## User Experience
User Flows: A user can either host or join an event. If they host an event, they will determine size of event, location, time, and what sport. If they are a participant they will review list of events and join the one they would want to partake in. If a user is hosting they can remove players they don't want. Users themselves can also leave event. Hosts can also delete events.
