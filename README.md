## Quick Start
### 0. Set up database (one time)
If you have not yet created your database, follow these steps:
- install SQL (if not yet installed)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
```
- Connect to mySQL as root user
```bash
mysql -u root -p 
# When prompted, enter root password
```
- Create a new database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE open_court 
-- this is the name you will use in the .env 
```
- Create a user and grant privileges
```sql
CREATE USER 'username'@'0.0.0.0';  -- fix this
GRANT ALL PRIVELEGES ON open_court TO 'username'@'0.0.0.0'; -- is the 0.0.0.0 right?
FLUSH PRIVELEGES;
EXIT;
```
**ðŸš©ðŸš©ðŸš©Augy - What was the line to create a user at any ip with a password? (SEE 'Create a user' ABOVE) ðŸš©ðŸš©ðŸš©**
- Create tables and add seed data
Configure a connection to the database in Workbench, then run [create_tables](./src/database/create_tables.sql) to create the tables and [seed_tables](./src/database/seed_tables.sql) to seed the tables with some quick sample data.

### 1. Set up environmental variables
Copy the [template.env](./template.env) into a new .env and fill in the variables as indicated in the comments.

Command line from project root:
```bash
cp template.env .env
nano .env # open .env for editing
```

### 2. Run Scripts

#### Set up server

Command line from project root:
```bash
cd src/server
npm i
npm run pm2
npm run pm2-log
```
*Note: If you need to force pm2 to stop, run `npm run pm2-stop`.*

#### Set up frontend

Command line from **server directory**:
```bash
cd ../frontend/opencourt
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Big Picture

**Problem Statement**: Solves the problem on not being able to find places for open play for sports such as pickleball, basketball, tennis, volleyball, etc.

## Project Description
OpenCourt solves the problem on not being able to find places for open play for sports such as pickleball, basketball, tennis, volleyball, etc.

**Target Users**: Anyone that wants to play, socialize, or get active.

### Data Model Planning
**Core Entities**: Events, Users, Location

**Key Relationships**: Users can host Events, Events can have multiples Users, Events have one location, Locations can host multiple events

**CRUD Operations**:
1. Users can create events
2. Users can join events
3. Users can view events and participants
4. Hosts can remove users
5. Hosts can update event details
6. Users can leave events
7. Hosts can delete events

### User Experience

**User Flows**:
A user can either **host** or **participate** in an event. 
- **Hosts**
    - determine the event size, sport, location, and time.
    - can remove players or delete events
- **Participants**
    - can browse and join events.
    - can leave an event anytime.
